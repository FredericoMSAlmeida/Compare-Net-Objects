```

# Features

## Feature Overview
* Compare Children (on by default)
* Handling for Trees with Children Pointing To Parents (Circular References)
* Compares Publicly Visible Class Fields and Properties
* Compares Private Fields and Properties (off by default)
* Source code in C#
* NUnit Test Project Included
* Ability to load settings from a config file for use with powershell
* Ability to pass in the configuration
* Ability to save and load the configuration as json
* Test Extensions .ShouldCompare and .ShouldNotCompare
* Several configuration options for comparing private elements, ignoring specific elements, including specific elements.
* Property and Field Info reflection caching for increased performance
* Rich Differences List or simple DifferencesString
* Supports custom comparison functions
* ElapsedMilliseconds indicates how long the comparison took
* Thread Safe
* Beyond Compare Report
* WinMerge Report
* CSV Report
* User Friendly Report 

## Options
* Ability to IgnoreCollectionOrder to compare lists of different lengths
* Ability to ignore indexer comparison
* Ability to ignore types
* Ability to ignore specific members by name or by wildcard
* Interface member filtering
* Ability to treat string.empty and null as equal
* Case insensitive option for strings

## Supported Types
* Classes
* Dynamic Objects
* Primitive Types (String, Int, Boolean, etc.)
* Structs
* IList Objects
* Single and Multi-Dimensional Arrays
* IDictionary Objects
* Enums
* Timespans
* Guids
* Classes that Implement IList with Integer Indexers
* DataSet Data
* DataTable Data
* DataRow Data
* DataColumn Differences
* LinearGradient
* HashSet
* URI
* IPEndPoint
* Types of Type (RuntimeType)
* StringBuilder

# Limitations
* Custom Collections with Non-Integer Indexers cannot be compared.
* When ignoring the collection order, the collection matching spec cannot be a field on a child class.  It has to be a property or field of the class.
* The Portable and .NET Standard builds cannot compare private fields or properties on a classs.  This is a security restriction by Microsoft.
* ElapsedMilliseconds does not work for Portable and .NET Standard builds as there is no StopWatch in those frameworks.
